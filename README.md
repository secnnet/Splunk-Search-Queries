Hey there! 👋🏼

I just wanted to let you know that I've uploaded a spreadsheet for you filled with Splunk search queries related to security. How awesome is that? 😎

And the best part is that you have the freedom to change and amend these search queries according to your preferences. So, feel free to make any adjustments that you think will work best for you.

Oh, and just a heads up, I'll occasionally update the spreadsheet and include a version number. So make sure to keep an eye out for any updates!

Hope you find this helpful and have a great day! 🤗
