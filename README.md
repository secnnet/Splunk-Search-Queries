Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am pleased to inform you that I have recently uploaded a comprehensive set of AQL queries containing a variety of HUNTERS search queries specifically tailored for security purposes.

One of the key features of this resource is its flexibility. You are more than welcome to modify and adapt the search queries to suit your unique requirements and preferences. This ensures that you have full control over the customization process, enabling you to achieve optimal results.

Please note that I will periodically update the AQL queries to reflect the latest advancements and improvements in the field. Each update will come with a version number, so I advise you to keep an eye out for any changes to make sure you have access to the most recent information.

I trust that you will find this resource both valuable and user-friendly. Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out.

I wish you a productive and successful day.
